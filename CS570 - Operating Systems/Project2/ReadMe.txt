This is a project completed by Allan Sur and Jason Songvilay.

The goal of this project was to showcase the use of threads by creating a program that, when input, would display a progress bar as each character was read and once done, output a correct word count of the file.
Proper Usage: ./wordcount 'filename'.txt
