#CS320-Programming Languages
This class was completed in the summer of 2020.

1. regular_Expressions.py: Created a Python3 script which reads input from the user, parses it using a regular expression to see if it meets valid criteria, and produced some output to the screen.

2. METALHEAD_Sur.cpp: Created a single class in C++ that models a 6 string guitar and the driver function to demonstrate the design's corretness. The class also posseses several methods relating to determining the pitch associated with a string and fret combination as well as a few private fields to hold information about the guitar's configuration.

3. PasswordGame.cpp: Collaborated with 2 other colleagues to create a program that acceps a text file as input, parses for word-specific tokens, generates a password of the user's required length, and bruteforce attempts to guess the password to show its strength.
